# Pandas--Challenge
This analysis is conducted in a step-by-step manner using Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks as tools to handle school and student data. This analysis entails merging and analyzing information from two separate CSV files that highlight crucial indicators such as the school budget, student performance measures, among others.

In essence, major highlights involve the identification of the schools performing at their best as well as those that perform worse based on the overall passing rate, studentsâ€™ performance analysis in various grades, and also exploring the effect of school spending and size on academic outcomes.

The data analysis brings useful information to educators, policymakers, and interested parties who use it as an important tool for making evidence-based decisions in relation to student success and educational efficiency.
